to play - two players must each have a deck.  a field must be chosen.

valid deck: 45 cards.  no augment violations
  one player "card" chosen. it does not count towards the card count.

what constitutes an augment violation?
  basic augments with no game breaking abilities should not have any augment violations
    for instance, basic stats.  any amount of creatures with a 2/2 augment should be allowed.
  advanced augments may have limitations
    for instance, a card that speeds up satellite orbit speeds may only have 3 allowed in the deck
  I believe the most i'll limit any augment to is 3 copies in a deck.
  Some augments may be limited, but not as limited as the 3.
  Maybe that could be indicated by 'rarity'? the most rare augments are the most limited, and on down
  rarity should indicate how often they will show up in your deck. NOT how often you obtain them.
  
Player cards:
  determine things like
    base health
    mana gains (colors, amounts per turn)
    base placement (maybe)
    hero power (catch up mechanic? auto triggered ability? activated ability with cooldown?)
  Each may have one augment slot.  (maybe more? maybe that is something that can be adjusted? probably not adjustable)

    Minion

  start with base card:
    minion
    satellite
    tech
  each base card has a number of augment slots
  these augment slots are filled by an augment of the appropriate type
  this creates the final card

  has two or more colors?
